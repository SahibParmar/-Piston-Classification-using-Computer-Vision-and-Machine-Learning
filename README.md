**Piston Defect Classification using CNN**

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify piston images and determine whether they contain defects or not.
Overview

**This repository contains:**

    Dataset: Provided as zip file
    Model: Implementation of a CNN for defect classification.
    Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Results**

The trained model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set and demonstrates robustness in identifying piston defects.
